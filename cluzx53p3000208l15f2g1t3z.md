The Scout-A-Route project is now initialized and the basic setup is complete. I'll go through the steps I took to get here.

### **GitHub Repository & Project**

Nothing fancy here, I just created a GitHub repository and added a short description. The repository has a `main` branch that will eventually be used for production and a `develop` branch which will be used for, well, development. Any features that I work on will happen on a separate branch which will be merged into `develop`, and eventually into `main`. I also set up a simple GitHub Project with a Kanban board, a Backlog and a Roadmap (these are all pre-existing templates). I also added a first Milestone to my GitHub repository (called "Project setup") and a few tasks to get started. Feel free to check out the [repository](https://github.com/ioanat94/scout-a-route) and the [project](https://github.com/users/ioanat94/projects/4/).

### **Project Initialization**

Since I'm using Svelte for this app, the project initialization was very simply done using `npm create svelte@latest`. As you can see from the screenshot below, the CLI tool guides you through the process step-by-step and asks if you want to use Typescript, linting, testing, and so on. When I ran `npm install` I actually encountered an issue with a dependency conflict between `eslint` and `typescript-eslint`. After some googling I found out that this is a [known issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12105) with a few temporary fixes available. I chose to manually downgrade `eslint` to `^8.56.0` but I imagine this issue will be fixed in the near future.

### **Setting up linting**

I opted to add ESLint and Prettier to my project during the `create svelte` process, as you can see above. I have not messed with the ESLint configuration yet since the default options usually work fine for me. I will add rules and whatnot as I go along and notice a need for them. My Prettier config is also quite basic and mostly a matter of personal preference (i.e. single vs double quotes, trailing commas, etc.)

### **Setting up testing**

Same as linting, I opted to add testing tools to my project during the `create svelte` process. Specifically, I will be using Vitest for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing. Upon installation, one simple test is automatically created for both of them. I haven't added any additional tests for now but I plan to test the app thoroughly once I implement some features.

```typescript
// Vitest
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
​
describe("sum test", () => {
  it("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
    expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
  });
});
```

```typescript
// Playwright
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";
​
test("index page has expected h1", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");
  await expect(page.getByRole("heading", 
    { name: "Welcome to SvelteKit" })).toBeVisible();
});
```

### **Setting up husky**

[husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is a tool that basically allows you to run certain commands when you make a commit or push your code to a repository. In my case, I have a pre-commit hook that runs `npm run lint`, which is a script equivalent to `prettier --check . && eslint .` . This command will run whenever I make a commit, and it will check that my code is formatted properly. If not, it won't allow me to make my commit until I fix the issues. I also have a pre-push hook that runs `npm run test`, which runs the commands `playwright test` and `vitest run`. This means that whenever I try to push my code, all unit and end-to-end tests will be run to make sure that I haven't broken anything. If a test doesn't pass, the push doesn't go through and I'll have to fix my code.

### **Setting up Tailwind and DaisyUI**

I followed [this guide](https://daisyui.com/blog/how-to-install-sveltekit-and-daisyui/) for setting up DaisyUI with Svelte and it was a breeze. Usually when I try to add Tailwind and/or DaisyUI to a project, some kind of issue pops up that I have to spend time sorting out, but this time everything went very smoothly and no issues were encountered. I will probably customize my theme at some point, but for now I'll be going forward with just the default Daisy theme.

### **Setting up Google Maps API**

This one was a bit tricky since I've never worked with this particular API before. Most of the setting up was done in the Google Cloud console as I had to set up my project, billing, restrictions, usage limits and so on. Once I had my API key I used the Google Maps API documentation to learn how to display a map on my page, and after some trial and error it worked! I'll have to experiment with the API quite a lot to figure out what I need and how to get the results I want.

### **Next steps**

First and foremost I need to do some planning. I'll try to split the work that needs to be done into small tasks and add them to my Project board. I also have lots to learn about the Google Maps API and I expect it will take some time to figure out how to do what I want to do. Anyway, I'm excited about the journey ahead. Thanks for reading and see you next time!
